# EKS Anywhere

## Introduction

EKS Anywhere is a new deployment option for Amazon EKS that allows customers to create and operate Kubernetes clusters on customer-managed infrastructure, supported by AWS. Customers can now run Amazon EKS Anywhere on their own on-premises infrastructure. Recently, support was provided for using a Docker host as a development and testing environment. Here, we provide a turnkey solution.

## Administrative Machine

At the time of this writing, the latest versions of macOS are not supported. Microsoft Windows is not supported. In an effort to provide the most flexible components, we will use Ubuntu 20.24.2 LTS, known as Focal Fossa. These instructions assume you have Vagrant and Virtualbox installed.
